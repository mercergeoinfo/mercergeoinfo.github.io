# CV head

I am a geographer with a talent for data collection and management, experienced in field work, both as a surveyor and as glaciologist.
I have worked in challenging environments such as Antarctica and the Swedish Arctic and spent many years teaching, in the lab as well as in the field. 
My various roles have demanded of me an ability to switch between independence, teamwork and leadership.
Teaching has given me a broad experience of interacting with people and understanding their expectations as well as their abilities.
I am now looking to, once again, broaden my experience and undertake new challenges.
